You can call it beautiful code when the code looks like +
"the language was made for the problem"

[.smaller]
Remember - A blackJack is when there are only 2 cards and the total is 21

You're right - absolutely nothing. 
I know - Shameless

## Refactoring - Why?
image::little-dog-fence.jpeg[little-dog,640,480]

[.smaller-bullet]
* If the code was well designed to begin with, will we ever have to refactor it again?
* When is the right time to refactor?
* Isn't the cost of refactoring later the same as refactoring now?


## JUnit - Unit Testing - Why?
[%step]
* to help us design the API
* so that when someone in the future refactors, they don't break the original requirements
* to validate that the unit works

## JUnit - What is a unit?
For every class X in a code base, there is a corresponding class XTest that is a sibling class meant to test the class X.


## Leap Years


To decide if a year is a leap year we use the following algorithm:

* if it is evenly divisible by 400 (no remainder), it is a leap year.
* after that, if it is evenly divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.
* after that, if it is evenly divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
* after that, if it is not a leap year.

So now we need to find years that will make good test candidates to verify the above

What years would you choose and why?
